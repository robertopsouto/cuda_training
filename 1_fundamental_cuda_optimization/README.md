## 1 - Matrix Row/Column Sums

Your first Assignment is to create a simple matrix row and column sum application in CUDA. The code skeleton is already given to you in `matrix_sums.cu`. Edit that file, paying attention to the `FIXME` locations so that the output runs such as:

```
row sums correct!
column sums correct!
```

After editing the code, compile it using the following:
```
$ module load cuda/12.0
$ nvcc -o matrix_sums matrix_sums.cu
```

The `module load` command selects a CUDA compiler for your use. The module load command must only be done once per session/login. `nvcc` is the CUDA compiler invocation command. The syntax is generally similar to gcc/g++.

To run your code, we will use a straightforward Slurm command:

```
$ srun --reservation=curso --gres=gpu:1 matrix_sums
```

## 2 - Profiling

We will introduce a new tool, the `nsys profile`, and use it to measure kernel execution times and then gather additional metrics to help interpret our observations.

Before proceeding, make sure you have completed the first Assignment. Then, use the following command to launch `nsys profile`: (*You may wish to expand your terminal window to more easily read the output*)

```
srun --reservation=curso --gres=gpu:1 nsys profile --stats=true -t cuda --cuda-memory-usage=true matrix_sums
```

Review the generated output:

- Which lines report the kernel execution durations?
- Do the reported kernel durations appear to be the same or different?
- Given your understanding, would you expect the durations to be identical or vary?
